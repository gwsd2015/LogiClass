Logic Based Learning in a Mobile Classroom: 
-------------------------------------------

The goal is to create an online classroom environment for learning logic through logic-grid puzzles. Usually solved by using a grid, these puzzles provide clues that are then used to draw certain conclusions. There will be separate interfaces for the students and the instructors. The instructors will be able to assign puzzles that have already been created as well as design their own. Both pre-designed puzzles and custom puzzles will have difficulty ratings. Students will then be able to view and solve the puzzles that have been assigned. The program will keep track of how long the students take to complete each puzzle and how many mistakes they made.
